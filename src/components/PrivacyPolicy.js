                <TextTitle>Information we collect or receive
                </TextTitle>
                <Text>We only collect, use, share, store, or otherwise process your personal information when we have a reasonable motive to do so. For example, we may process your personal information as necessary to provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as our Terms of Use. We may process your personal information when necessary to comply with legal obligations or for purposes of pursuing legitimate interests, if doing so is consistent with your rights and appropriate to the context, such as providing services, addressing game performance, fixing bugs, performing internal analytics, and conducting reasonable monitoring of your use of our services to prevent misuse of our services and fraud. Additionally, we may, in certain cases, ask you for your consent for certain processing of your personal information.</Text>
                <Text>We generally collect or receive information in three ways: (a) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (b) we collect information automatically, such as through cookies or other software, and (c) other parties, such as social networks, may provide information to us. Each of these methods is described in more detail below.</Text>
                <TextTitle>(a) Information you voluntarily choose to provide
                </TextTitle>
                <Text>You may provide your personal information to us when you choose to use our websites, software, or applications. As our products and features may change, the options you have to provide us with information also may change. The following are some examples of situations in which you may provide information to us:
                </Text>
                <Text>Creating an account to use our websites, online services, software, or applications; Licensing and downloading our products; Purchasing something from us or otherwise engaging in a transaction with us; Entering online competitions or registering for or participating in special events; Entering contests or sweepstakes, participating in any of our promotions, or accepting any prizes from us; Signing up for email alerts and newsletters or subscribing to receive other information from us; Completing a survey; Using a mobile device, such as a phone, to use our applications; Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service.

The information you provide to us may include your name, your display name, and your email address(es). If you choose to make a purchase, we will collect payment card information such as your card’s payment account number and expiration date. Sometimes we ask for your phone number, your postal address, your billing address, your date of birth, and your gender.
                </Text>
                <Text>Some of our websites also provide a feature that supports job applications, in which case we also ask for your resume, name, and email address. We use this information to determine if you are qualified for the position for which you applied or to contact you to set up an interview</Text>
                <TextTitle>(b) Information collected automatically when you use our websites, software, and applications
                </TextTitle>
                <Text>We collect some information automatically when you visit our websites or use our software and applications. If a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information. We typically aggregate the data that we collect automatically and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals.
                </Text>
                <Text>We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, and web beacons, and our back-end servers collect usage data transmitted from our software and applications. We use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud or misuse of our services, and conducting data analytics. The type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:</Text>
                <Text>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications); Usage information and statistics about your interaction with our websites, software, and applications, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used, how long you used it and when, and other usage statistics; Crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a program or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash;
                    Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as your display name or other user identification provided in connection with your application use or saved preferences, progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes; The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device’s IP address. Please note that if certain features on our website are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of our website or others’ websites over time. These features are subject to those third parties’ privacy notices and policies.
                </Text>
                <TextTitle>(c) Information we receive from other</TextTitle>
                <Text>In some cases, other parties provide us with information about you or allow us to collect information about you. We generally collect or receive information from other parties in four ways: (1) you use our software or applications through a website or device that is not controlled by us, such as a game console or social network, (2) you choose to use a social feature of our software or applications, (3) you purchase our software or applications from another party, or (4) you use our software that contains or require anti-cheat services from other parties. In some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties like social networks, make available to us. In those cases, we use only the data that we need to provide the types of services we think our users want and expect. Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.</Text>
                <TextTitle>When you use our software and applications on third-party websites
                </TextTitle>
                <Text>When you use any "Dream Vortex" JSC product, application, or feature through a website not controlled by "Dream Vortex" JSC, such as a social network, that website may allow "Dream Vortex" JSC access to certain information about you. For example, social networks may provide us with information from your profile on their websites such as contact information, demographics, and other details you provided to that website such as your photo, user name, and potentially any and all information that you agreed the social network or other parties could provide to us when you use our games and applications</Text>
                <TextTitle>When you use the social features of our software and applications</TextTitle>
                <Text>When you choose to use a social feature of our games and applications, you allow "Dream Vortex" JSC to receive information about you from social networks. Our social features promote and facilitate interaction among players, such as by allowing you and your friends to work together to meet a shared challenge presented by our game or application. You may be able to use these features to find out if your friends are actively playing the game and using the feature, to find out if they used it in the past, and to invite them to join you to meet in a game challenge.</Text>
                <Text>
                    If you choose to use one of our social features, you may be asked to log into a social network through our game or application. The social network may then provide "Dream Vortex" JSC with information such as your social network user ID, your profile picture, and the user IDs and profile pictures of your connections.</Text>
                <TextTitle>When you buy our products from other parties
                </TextTitle>
                <Text>We may also receive information about you from the organizations that sell our games, hardware or applications, or which provided the product you use. Those parties may provide us with information regarding your account or registration, but they do not give us your payment information. Because those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but it is likely to include information such as your name, email address, user ID, location, and date of birth.
                </Text>
                <TextTitle>How we use and share information
                </TextTitle>

                    - To the extent, you give consent, such as when we would like to process your personal information for a purpose that would otherwise be incompatible with this policy.

                <Text>We may also disclose information about you: (1) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, or a reasonable request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (2) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or (3) if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual (such as to prevent death, bodily harm, or serious damage to property). We reserve the right to transfer information about our users in the event we sell or transfer all or substantially all our business or assets.</Text>
                <TextTitle>Your Choices</TextTitle>
                <Text>We provide you with choices about whether to provide us with personal information and whether it is shared. For example, we may seek your prior consent for certain processing. We are required to seek your consent before we use your personal information for any purpose incompatible with the purposes identified in this policy. You may withdraw your consent at any time by sending an email as specified in the “How to contact us” section below.

                    <br />
                    - You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies. Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser “do not track” signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.

                    <br />

                <Text>We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, use, and other unlawful forms of processing.

                </Text>
                <TextTitle>Children’s privacy</TextTitle>
                <Text>"Dream Vortex" JSC does not direct its software or applications to children (usually considered to be under the age of 13, depending on the country where you reside). We also do not intentionally collect personal information from children through our websites, software, or applications. If you are the parent or guardian of a child and you believe that we have inadvertently received personal information about that child, please contact us as described in the “How to contact us” section of this policy and we will delete the information from our records.</Text>
                <TextTitle>Transfers of information
                </TextTitle>
                <Text>As part of our international operations, we may transfer information about you to any jurisdiction where we do business. When you use our websites, software, hardware, or applications, you acknowledge that we may transfer information about you as described in this policy.</Text>
                <Text>
                    We will transfer your personal information for any of the purposes identified in this policy to our subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers, and business partners that may be located outside of the jurisdiction where you are located. The laws in those jurisdictions may not provide the same level of data protection compared to the laws in your country. However, we will treat your personal information as subject to the protections described in this policy.
                </Text>
                <Text>When we transfer personal information from the EU to entities within our organization located outside of the EU, we rely on standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards. If we transfer personal information from the EU to another party located outside the EU, we will rely on a legal framework that provides appropriate safeguards, which could include the standard contractual clauses, binding corporate rules, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program, or another framework deemed adequate by the European Commission.</Text>
                <TextTitle>Additional privacy rights and obligations
                </TextTitle>
                <Text>This section sets out rights applicable only to personal information processed by "Dream Vortex" JSC or to the personal data of individuals located in the EU, and our obligations regarding their personal information.</Text>
                <Text>If you are located in the EU or "Dream Vortex" JSC processes your personal information in the EU, then you have the right to restrict or object to our processing of your personal information. The right to restrict processing arises only in limited circumstances, for example, if you think we are processing inaccurate information. In addition, if we are required to restrict processing but the requirement is temporary, we may not be permanently obligated to adhere to your request. "Dream Vortex" JSC will, however, let you know when the restriction is lifted. In cases where our basis for processing your information is the satisfaction of our legitimate interests (e.g., fraud prevention), you may object to our processing. However, we will decline your request if our interest in continuing to process your information is sufficiently compelling to legally override your interest in the request, or if our processing is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim. You also may prevent us from sending direct marketing at any time without limitation. To request a restriction or to object to processing, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to contact us” section below.</Text>
                <Text>Similarly, if you are located in the EU or "Dream Vortex" JSC entities located in the EU process your personal information, then we will provide you with the ability to request access to and correction or deletion of your personal information. If you have an account with us, you can access and update your account information at any time by logging into your account through our website. You also may request that we provide you with a copy of your personal information, update it or delete it on your behalf. Your right to request access, correction, or deletion is sometimes limited. For example, we will not provide you with access to information that includes personal information about another person, and we will keep limited personal information notwithstanding a request to delete it if necessary for us to establish, exercise, or defend against a legal claim. To request access to, or correction or deletion of your personal information, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to contact us” section below.
                </Text>
                <Text>Individuals located in the EU or whose personal information is processed by "Dream Vortex" JSC in the EU also have the right to obtain their personal information so they can transfer it to another party, or ask us to do so on their behalf, which we will do when technically feasible. This right is limited and only arises when our processing of your information is automated and based on your consent or our user agreements and/or terms and conditions. To exercise this right, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to contact us” section below. To the extent EU data protection law is applicable to you, you have the right to establish instructions in respect of the preservation, deletion, and transmission of your personal data after your death. To exercise this right, please submit your request by sending an email to the address specified in the “How to contact us” section below.</Text>
                <Text>
                    "Dream Vortex" JSC has appointed a data protection officer to address questions and requests related to our implementation of EU data protection requirements.
